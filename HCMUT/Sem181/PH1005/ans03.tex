\begin{itemize}
  \item 1. Electromagetic field is a force field that can exerts both
    electric force and magnetic force on a moving charge.
  \item 2. Electromagetic wave is the disturbance consists of two components
    varying through time and propagating in space.
  \item 3.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Electric flux is the measure of the distribution of electric field
        through a given surface.
      \begin{align*}
        \Phi_E = \IINT_{}^{} E dS = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}
               = \INT_{}^{} E dA = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} 
      \end{align*}
        (surface integral)
    \end{itemize}
      \item Magnetic flux is the measure of the distribution of magnetic field
        through a given surface.
      \begin{align*}
        \Phi_E = \IINT_{S}^{} E dS = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}
      \end{align*}
  \item 4. Changing electric flux:

  \item 5. b
  \item 6. b
  \item 7. b
  \item 8. different from 0
  \item 12.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item permittivity: how well the material resists the forming of an
        electric field
      \item permeability: how well the material support/allow the forming of a
        magnetic field
    \end{itemize}
  \item 18. speed of light is equals to speed of propagation of electromagetic
    wave
\end{itemize}
