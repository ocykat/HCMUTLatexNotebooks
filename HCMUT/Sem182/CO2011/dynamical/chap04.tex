  \hii{Logistic Model}
    \par Logistic Population Model:
      \[
        \dif{P}{t} = kP\bigg(1 - \frac{P}{K}\bigg) \qquad P(0) = P_0
      \]
      where:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $P(t)$: population at time $t$
        \item $k$: relative growth rate coefficient
        \item $K$: carrying capacity
        \item $P_0$: initial population
      \end{itemize}
    \par Solve the differential equation, we obtain:
      \[
        P(t) = \frac{K}{1 + Ae^{-kt}} \qquad A = \frac{K - P_0}{P_0}
      \]
  
  \hii{Modifications}
    \par \tb{Populations that are subject to “harvesting”}: Sometimes a population can be taken
    away or harvested at a constant rate.
    \[
      \dif{P}{t} = kP\bigg(1 - \frac{P}{K}\bigg) - c
    \]
    where $c$ represents the rate per time period the population is harvested
    \par \tb{Population becomes extinct}: when the population falls below a minimum population $m$:
    \[
      \dif{P}{t} = kP\bigg(1 - \frac{P}{K}\bigg)\bigg(1 - \frac{m}{P}\bigg)
    \]
