* Discrete Distributions

* Continuous Distributions

** Continuous Uniform Distribution
*** Definition
  A continuous random variable $X$ is called a *continuous uniform random variable* if its density function is:
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) = \frac{1}{(b - a)}
    \end{align*}

*** Mean and Variance
  If $X$ is a continuous uniform random variable over $a \leq x \leq b$, then:
    \begin{align*}
        E(X) &= \mu  = \frac{a + b}{2} \\
        V(X) &= \sigma^2  = \frac{(b - a)^2}{2}
    \end{align*}


** Normal Distribution
*** Intuitive meaning of Normal Distribution
  A random variable $X$ follows a normal distribution if $X$ is the result of a random experiment where the occurence of the mean value is the highest.
*** Definition
*** Notation
$X ~ N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of $X$.
