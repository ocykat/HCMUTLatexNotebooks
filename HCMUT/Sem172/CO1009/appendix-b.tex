\hi{Introduction}
  \par Oscilloscope is a type of electronic test instrument that allows
  observation of varying signal voltages, usually as a two-dimensional
  plot of one or more signals as a function of time.

\hi{The display}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vertical Scale: the range of \tb{voltage} on the display
  \item Horizontal Scale: the range of \tb{time} on the display
  \item Vertical Position: the position of the \tb{voltage} scale.
  \item Horizontal Position: the position fo the range of time.
  \item Trigger Point: a horizontal line which should be placed
    in between the signal range to stabilize the signal.
\end{itemize}
