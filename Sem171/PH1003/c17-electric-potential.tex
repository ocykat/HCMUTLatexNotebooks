    \hii{Potential Difference}
        \par For an infinitesimal displacement $ds$ of a charge, the work done by the electric field
        on the charge is:
        \begin{align*}
            dW = F \cdot ds = q_{0} E \cdot ds
        \end{align*}
        \par The change in potential energy would be:
        \begin{align*}
            dU = -dW = - q_{0} E \cdot ds
        \end{align*}
        \par If the electric charge is moved from $A$ to $B$:
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta U = - \Delta W = - q_{0} \INT{_{A}^{B} E \cdot ds}
        \end{align*}
        \par Since the force $q_{0}E$ is \impt{conservative}, \textit{the integral does not depend on
        the path taken from $A$ to $B$}.
    \hii{Electric Potential}
        \par The electric potential is independent of the value of $q_{0}$ and has a value at every
        point in an electric field.
        \begin{eqbox}
            V = \frac{U}{q_{0}}
        \end{eqbox}
        \begin{eqbox}
            \Dt V = \frac{\Dt U}{q_{0}} = \frac{- q_{0} \INT{_{A}^{B} E \cdot ds}}{q_{0}}
            = - \INT{_{A}^{B} E \cdot ds}
        \end{eqbox}
    \hii{Work done by the Electric Field}
        \begin{eqbox}
            W = q \Dt V
        \end{eqbox}
