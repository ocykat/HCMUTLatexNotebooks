\chapter{Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design}

\par In this chapter, we assume that a file already exists with some primary organization such as the unordered, ordered, or hashed organizations.
\par \tb{Indexes} are additional auxiliary \tb{access structure} that are used to speed up the retrieval of records under certain search conditioins, providing \tb{secondary access path} that does not affect the physical placement of records in the primary data file on disk.
\par Efficient access to records is based on the \tb{indexing fields} that are used to construct the index. Any field of the file can be used to create an index. Also, multiple indexes on different fields or indexes on multiple fields can be created within a file.

\hi{Types of Single-Level Ordered Indexes}
  \par The idea behind an ordered index is similar to that behind the index used in a textbook, which lists important terms at the end of the book in alphabetical order along with a list of page numbers where the term appears in the book.
  \par An index access structure is usually defined on a single field of a file, called an indexing field (or indexing attribute). The index typically stores each value of the index field along with a list of pointers to all disk blocks that contain records with that field value. The values in the index are ordered so that we can do a binary search on the index. If both the data file and the index file are ordered, and since the index file is typically much smaller than the data file, searching the index using a binary search is a better option.
  \par Types of ordered indexes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A \tb{primary index} is specified on the \tb{ordering key field} of an ordered file of records.
    \item If numerous records in the file \tb{have the same value for the ordering field}, then \tb{clustering index} is used.
    \item A \tb{secondary index} can be specified on any \tb{nonordering field} of a file.
  \end{itemize}

  \hii{Primary Indexes}
    \par A \tb{primary index} is an \tb{ordered file} whose records are of fixed length with two fields:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first field is of the same data type as the ordering key field - called the \tb{primary key} - of the data file.
      \item The second field is a pointer to a disk block (a block address)
    \end{itemize}
    \par The two field values of index entry $i$ can be denoted as $\pair{K(i), P(i)}$.
    \img[width=14cm]{img/primary-index.png}{}
    \par In the figure, the \ilc{Name} field is the primary key because it is the \tb{ordering key field} of the file with the assumption that each value is unique. Each entry in the index has a \ilc{Name} value and a pointer.
    \par The total number of entries in the index is the same as the number of disk blocks in the ordered data file.
    \par The first record in each block of the data file is called the \tb{anchor record} of the block, or the \tb{block anchor}.
    \par Indexes can also be characterized as dense or sparse. A dense index has an index entry for every search key value (and hence every record) in the data file. A sparse (or nondense) index, on the other hand, has index entries for only some of the search values.

  \hii{Clustering Indexes}
    \par If file records are \tb{physically ordered on a nonkey field} which does not have a distinct value for each record, that field is called the \tb{clustering field} and the data file is called a \tb{clustered file}. We can create a different type of index, called a clustering index, to speed up retrieval of all the records that have the same value for the clustering field.

    \par A clustering index is \tb{an ordered file} with two fields:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first field is of the same type as the clustering field of the data file
      \item The second field is a disk block pointer
    \end{itemize}
    \par There is \tb{one entry} in the clustering index \tb{for each distinct value} of the clustering field, and it contains the value and a pointer to the first block in the data file that has a record with that value for its clustering field.
    \par To alleviate the problem of insertion (and deletion), it is common to reserve a whole block (or a cluster of contiguous blocks) for each value of the clustering field.

  \hii{Secondary Indexes}
    \par A \tb{secondary index} provides a secondary means of accessing a data file for which some primary access already exists. The data file records could be ordered, unordered, or hashed. The secondary index may be created on a field that is a candidate key and has a unique value in every record, or on a nonkey field with duplicate values.
    \par The index is an \tb{ordered file} with two fields:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first field is of the same data type as some \tb{nonordering field} of the data file that is an indexing field.
      \item The second field is either a block pointer or a record pointer.
    \end{itemize}
    \par Many secondary indexes (and hence, indexing fields) can be created for the same file - each represents an additional means of accessing that file based on some specific field.
    \par A secondary index provides a \tb{logical ordering} on the records by the indexing field. If we access the records in order of the entries in the secondary index, we get them in order of the indexing field. The primary and clustering indexes assume that the field used for \tb{physical ordering} of records in the file is the same as the indexing field.

\hi{Multilevel Indexes}
  \par In the indexing schemas described so far, \tb{binary search} is applied to the index to locate pointers to a disk block or to a record (or records) in the file having a specific index field value. Binary search requires approximately $\log_2(b_i)$ block accesses for an index with $b_i$ blocks.
  \par The idea behind \tb{multilevel index} is to reduce the part of the index that we continue to search by the blocking factor index $bfr_i > 2$, which reduces the search space much faster. The value $bfr_i$ is called the \tb{fan-out} of the multilevel index, denoted by $fo$.
  \par Whereas we divide the record search space into two halves at each step during a binary search, we divide it n-ways (where $n = fo$) at each search step using the multilevel index. Searching a multilevel index requires approximately $log_{fo} b_i$ block accesses
  \img[width=14cm]{img/multilevel-index.png}{}
  \par The first level - the primary index for the data - is an ordered file with a distinct value for each $K(i)$. The second level is the primary index for the first level. The third level is the primary index for the second level, and so on.

\hi{Indexes on Multiple Keys}

\hi{Other Types of Indexes}
  \hii{Hash Indexes}
    \par The \tb{hash index} is a secondary structure to access the file by using hashing on a search key other than the one used for the primary data file organization.

  \hii{Bitmap Indexes}
    \par The \tb{bitmap index} is another popular data structure that facilitates \tb{querying on multiple keys}.
    \par Bitmap indexing is used for relations that contain a \tb{large number of rows}. It creates an index for one or more columns, and each value or value range in those columns is indexed.
    \par Typically, a bitmap index is created for those columns that contain \tb{a fairly small number of unique values}.
    \par To build a bitmap index on a set of records in a relation, the records must be numbered from 0 to $n$ with an id (a record id or a row id) that can be mapped to a physical address made of a block
number and a record offset within the block.
    \par A bitmap index is built on one particular value of a particular field (the column in a relation) and is just an array of bits. Consider a bitmap index for the column $C$ and a value $V$ for that column. For a relation with $n$ rows, it contains $n$ bits. The $i$th bit is set to 1 if the row $i$ has the value $V$ for column $C$; otherwise it is set to a 0. If $C$ contains the valueset $\pair{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m}$ with $m$ distinct values, then $m$ bitmap indexes would be created for that column.
    \img[width=12cm]{img/index-bitmap.jpg}{}
    \par In the figure, there are only 2 values of \ilc{Sex} and 3 values of \ilc{Zipcode}. Therefore, using bitmap indexing makes a lot of sense. 2 bitmaps are created for \ilc{Sex} and 3 for \ilc{Zipcode}.

  \hii{Function-Based Indexing}
    \par \tb{Example 1}: A function-based index on the \ilc{EMPLOYEE} table based on an uppercase representation of the \ilc{Lname} column

\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{SQL}
CREATE INDEX upper_ix ON Employee (UPPER(Lname));
\end{minted}
    
    \par The following query will use the index. Without the function-based index, an Oracle Database might perform a full table scan.

\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{SQL}
SELECT First_name, Lname
FROM Employee
WHERE UPPER(Lname)= "SMITH"
\end{minted}

    \par \tb{Example 2}: An index is being created on the sum of \ilc{salary} and \ilc{commission_pct}.
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{SQL}
CREATE INDEX income_ix
ON Employee(Salary + (Salary*Commission_pct));
\end{minted}

The query does use this index even though the order of attributes is reversed.

\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{SQL}
SELECT First_name, Lname
FROM Employee
WHERE ((Salary*Commission_pct) + Salary ) > 15000;
\end{minted}


\hi{Some General Issues Concerning Indexing}
  \hii{Logical vs Physical Indexes}
    \par An index entry $\pair{K, Pr}$ where $Pr$ is the physical pointer to a physical record address on disk is called a \tb{physical index}. The disadvantage is that the pointer must be changed if the record is moved to
    another disk location.
    \par A solution is \tb{logical address}, whose index entries are of the form $\pair{K, K_p}$, where $K$ is the secondary indexing field matched with the value $K_p$ of the field used for the primary file organization.
  
  \hii{Index Creation}
    \par General form of the index creation query:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{SQL}
CREATE [ UNIQUE ] INDEX < index name >
ON < table name > ( < column name > [ < order > ] { , < column name > [ < order > ] } )
[ CLUSTER ] ;
\end{minted}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The keywords \ilc{UNIQUE} and \ilc{CLUSTER} are optional.
      \item The keyword \ilc{CLUSTER} is used when the index to be created should also sort the data file records on the indexing attribute. Thus, specifying \ilc{CLUSTER} on a key (unique) attribute would create some variation of a primary index, whereas specifying \ilc{CLUSTER} on a nonkey (nonunique) attribute would create some variation of a clustering index.
      \item The value for \ilc{<order>} can be either \ilc{ASC} (ascending) or \ilc{DESC} (descending), and it specifies whether the data file should be ordered in ascending or descending values of the indexing attribute. The default is ASC.
    \end{itemize}

      \item Analyzing the Database Queries and Transactions
      \item Analyzing the Expected Frequency of Invocation of Queries and
      Transactions
      \item Analyzing the Time Constraints of Queries and Transactions
      \item Analyzing the Expected Frequencies of Update Operations

    \end{itemize}
  
  \hii{Physical Database Design Decisions}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Whether to index an attribute
      \item What attribute or attributes to index on
      \item Whether to set up a clustered index
        \par \tb{Range queries} benefit a great deal from clustering.
      \item Whether to use a hash index over a tree index
        \par Hash indexes work well with equality conditions, particularly during joins to find a matching record(s), but they do not
        support range queries.
      \item Whether to use dynamic hashing for the file
        \par \tb{Dynamic hashing} is used when files are very \tb{volatile}.
    \end{itemize}
