\hi{Electric Flux}
  \par Electric flux is the measure of the distribution of electric field
    through a given surface.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If electric fields vectors point out of the surface, there is an
      \ti{outward electric flux}.
    \item If electric fields vectors point into the surface, there is an
      \ti{inward electric flux}.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{eqbox}
    \Phi_E = \INT_{}^{} \vec{E} d\vec{A}
