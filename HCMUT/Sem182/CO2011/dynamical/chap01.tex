\hi{Solutions to Dynamical System}
  \par \tb{Theorem 1}: The solution of the linear dynamical system $a_{n + 1} = ra_{n}$ for $r \neq 0$: is
    \[
      a_k = r^k a_0
    \]
    where $a_0$ is a given initial value.
  \par A number $a$ is called an \tb{equilibrium value} or \tb{fixed point} of a dynamical system $a_{n + 1} = f(a_n)$ if $a_k = a$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots$ when $a_{0} = a$. That is, $a_{k} = a$ is a constant solution to the dynamical system.
  \par \tb{Theorem 2}: The equilibrium value for the dynamical system
  \[
    a_{n + 1} = r a_{n} + b \qquad r \neq 1
  \]
  is
  \[
    a = \frac{b}{1 - r}
  \]
  \par \tb{Theorem 3}: The solution of the dynamical system $a_{n + 1} = ra_{n} + b$, $r \neq 1$ is:
  \[
    a_{k} = r^{k} c + \frac{b}{1 - r}
  \]
  for some constant $c$ (which depends on the initial condition)
