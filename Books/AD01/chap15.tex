\hi{Elements of DP}
  \par To apply DP, a problem must have two things:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item optimal substructure
    \item overlapping subproblems
  \end{itemize}

  \hii{Optimal substructure}
    \par A problem exhibits \tb{optimal substructure} if an optimal solution to
      the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.

  \hii{Overlapping subproblems}
    \par When a recursive algorithm revisits the same problem repeatedly, we
    say that the optimization problem has \tb{overlapping subproblems}.
