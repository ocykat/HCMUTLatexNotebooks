\hi{General Differential Equations}
    \par A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates some
        function with its derivatives.
    \par The solution of a differential equation is a function or a family of
        functions.

\hi{Separable Differential Equation}
    \hii{Definition}
        \par A \impt{separable differential equation} is an equation that can be written
            in the form of:
        \begin{eqbox}
            f(x)dx = g(y)dy
        \end{eqbox}
        \par In simple words, $x$ and $y$ can be separated to the two sides of the equation.
    \hii{Reducing to Separable Differential Equation}
        \par A differential equation of the form:
        \begin{equation}
            f_{1}(x) g_{1}(y) dx = f_{2}(x) g_{2}(y) dy
        \end{equation}
        can be reduced to a separable differential equation by dividing both sides by
        ${f_{2}(x)g_{1}(y)}$:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{f_{1}(x)}{f_{2}(x)} dx = \frac{g_{2}(y)}{g_{1}(y)} dy
        \end{equation}
    \hii{Method}
        \par \textit{Sal Khan's Method}: transform the equation to the form:
        \begin{flalign*}
            & \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) g(y) \mendl
            & \ra \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = f(x) dx \mendl
        \end{flalign*}
